SSN 762,S6G,"Room is small, plenty of sunlight. Barge is semi-stable and easier to breathe on than the carrier. Smell of drip coffee permeates the air  .

SSN 798,S9G,"“Auditorium”, spacious, multiple tables with tablecloths spaced out in a large room. Tile floors. Set up table in corner to be able to plug in laptop. Feels like a fire hall. Room PCU Auditorium #4921 very large room where we rearranged tables and chairs for the group."
CVN 79,A1B,"Small office room, no large tables and a few chairs. Standing for most of interview required. Room is about 6 ft wide, 4-5 computers, storage lockers, manuals on shelves. The -DW is here! Per Drahos, “mostly IETMs” used on board, so only “essential” hardcopy manuals stored here. Reactor Networking Office, small office onboard, busy with phones ringing, a few desktop computers, and side conversations at times due to other activities going on at same time in other areas of the ship."
CVN 74,A4W,"Left ship and walked across high scaffolding into attached building. Went down a real “high school hallway” – blue lockers, tile floors, etc. Passed several classroom areas. Entered one, with 15 tables lined up   in rows. Large. Floating Accommodations Facility (FAF) Training Room 104 on CTE exam day so many Sailors not available. Large meeting room with a whiteboard, but no computers."
